# Tensorflow

In this section we would like to train a tensorflow model and run it throught the openvino model optimizer.

## Transfer Learning

In this section we train a model with a standard dataset. ImageNet, Mnist ...
After that we freeze the last layer and train it with our own dataset.

## New model

In this section we would like to train a completely new Tensorflow model.
