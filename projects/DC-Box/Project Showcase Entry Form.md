## How did the Intel® Edge AI Fundamentals Course help you in creating your project?

First, the Intel® Edge AI Fundamentals gave us the knowledge to start the project at all. Second, it also showed us that it is almost impossible to start an AI project without this knowledge. There are many problems to consider. In our opinion, people shouldn't take care of all the technical details. You should focus on the problem at hand, your goals and the data. The technical aspects should be taken from them as much as possible. This is how the idea of the DC box was born. Third, and perhaps the most valuable help from this course was the opportunity to build a team of great people to work with. Each of us focuses on a task, we helped and encouraged each other. Combine these three parts and you have the answer how the Intel® Edge AI Fundamentals Course helped us build our project.
